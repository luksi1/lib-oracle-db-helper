# lib-oracle-db-helper
A few helper classes to use for various Oracle database administration tasks.

## Description
A mess of different methods to help with Oracle database administration tasks. I used SQLPlus so that these classes could be used without installing Perl's Oracle libraries. In other words, they can be used as is.

## Dependencies
- Perl
- SQLPlus
