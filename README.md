# lib-oracle-db-helper
A few helper classes to use for various Oracle database administration tasks.

## Description
A mess of different methods to help with Oracle database administration tasks. I used SQLPlus so that these classes could be used without installing Perl's Oracle libraries. In other words, they can be used as is.

## Use case
Oracle is a midly frustrating database to administer. A lot of the tasks are repetitive, and not very straight-forward, but not daily. Instead of remembering the various commands, I simply created the methods that would do these tasks for me.

## Dependencies
- Perl
- SQLPlus
